### Why I made my project:
> Lately, I've been really craving desserts!
> While I was brainstorming ideas for a website, I thought, "Hey, why not make a site for rating how delicious desserts look?"

### How I made my project
> I used HTML and CSS to make the site!
> I added a few unplanned additions along the way, including the "All-Time Favourites" section.

### What I struggled with and what I learned:
> I struggled with placing the "Next" and "Back" buttons next to each other.
> I also had some issues with the rows of images.
> But at the end, I was able to solve both!
